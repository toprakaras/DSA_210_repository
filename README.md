#### INTRODUCTION

People aim to maintain a healthy lifestyle while doing diets and exercises, and many individuals are having trouble to find a well designed diet program and exercise program for reaching their goal body.

This project intend to analyze the differences between the diet effectiveness and a better exercise routine using self data. In order to determine how my personal eating patterns and physical activity habits affect important health indicators including weight change, body mass index (BMI), and energy levels, this study will examine the relationship between these two factors.

#### OBJECTIVES

To look at the relationship between my own eating habits and degree of physical activity.
To evaluate how my diet and activity affect my weight shifting and BMI over time.
To offer data-driven, self-reflective insights that could improve individual workout regimens.
To create statistical models that use individual nutrition and exercise data to forecast health outcomes.

#### DATA SOURCES

Health records such as weight, and  BMI.
Personal meal consumption and meal timing.
Apple health application for heart rate and step count.
Sleep and recovery data using tracking applications.

#### METHODOLOGY

**Data collection:** Metrics related to weight, activity, diet, and sleep should be recorded daily for at least four to six weeks.A spreadsheet, Apple Health exports, or an automated tracking tool will be used to gather data in a systematic manner.
Processing Data: Setting food consumption standards based on macronutrient and calorie breakdowns. Dividing workouts into three categories: low, moderate, and high intensity.

**Descriptive Statistics:** Measuing the change of weight, BMI, calorie intake, and activity levels.
Correlation Analysis: Relationship between diet, physical activity, and body weight changes.
***Hypothesis Testing:*** 
- *Null Hypothesis* (H0): There is no significant relationship between diet/exercise and health outcomes.
- *Alternative Hypothesis* (H1): Diet and exercise significantly influence BMI, weight change, and energy levels.
- *Interpretation and Perspectives*: Determining the best diet-exercise ratio for enhancing one's own health.
Knowing which factors—calorie intake, meal time, or exercise regimen—have the most effects on weight growth or decrease.
Creating a framework based on data to optimize eating and exercise patterns.


#### EXPECTED OUTCOMES

Identifying the main food and exercise habits that lead to better personal health indicators.
Predictive models that use trends in nutrition and activity to forecast individual health outcomes.
Using data-driven insights, personalized recommendations are generated to enhance diet and exercise regimens.
Being aware of how recovery and sleep impact fitness results.
